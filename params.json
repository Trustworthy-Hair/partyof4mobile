You can view the details of that event - who’s host, who’s coming, where, and when. If you see something interesting, request to join!\r\n\r\n#### Creating a new event\r\n![Creating a new event](images/join-event.gif)\r\nDon’t see anything you like? By clicking on the plus-sign, search for nearby restaurants with some info from FourSquare. When you find what you’re looking for, you can create an event at that location. Describe what you’re up to, set the planned time, and specify the maximum number of attendees. Other users will then find your event on their apps!\r\n\r\n#### Approving/rejecting people\r\n![Approving/rejecting people](images/approve-users.gif)\r\nIf you take a look at an event you’re hosting, you can see who wants to join. Take a look at their profile for their interests and ratings, and use that information to approve or decline the request.\r\n\r\n### Who we are.\r\nBrandon\r\n***\r\nNick\r\n***\r\nShelley\r\n***\r\nWarren\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
